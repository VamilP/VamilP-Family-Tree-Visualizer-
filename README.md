Society Tree Visualizer:
The tool should represent a caste family tree with 72 nodes, where each node represents a primary family branch. Upon clicking on a node, it should expand to show the surnames associated with that branch, along with their
respective deity and gotra information.

This JSON file contains information about different branches of Indian families, their Gotras (ancestral lineage), associated deities, and common surnames. 
Each entry includes:
1) Branch Name: The name of the family branch.
2) Gotra: The ancestral lineage associated with the branch.
3) Deity: The deity that the branch worships.
4) Surnames: A list of common surnames associated with the branch.
